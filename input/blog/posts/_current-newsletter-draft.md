### Marketing


#### Member resources
We'd like to make our members aware of some marketing resources you can take advantage of.

- *Help spread .NET Foundation's message*: Take a look at the [.NET Foundation slides](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/Marketing/EbxGONyybLRMoe6MgPNUEi4BdDuEWNLmdfV_s8INO9nWTw?e=mImEov) and use them in your presentations and events.
- *Promote your .NET open source content, events, project news*: If you'd like to promote something on the .NET Foundation social channels, fill out the [amplification request issue template on our content repo](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/content/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=content-amplification-request.md&title=%5BAMPLIFICATION%5D+-+Title) and we'll get you scheduled.

#### .NET branding guidelines
Microsoft released updated .NET branding guidelines on GitHub [github.com/dotnet/brand](https://github.com/dotnet/brand). The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework for communicating with the .NET developer community and establishing a consistent brand identity. This not only includes the logo & typeface but also consistent messaging, terminology, fun illustrations and presentation templates you can use.

## New Releases

### Chem4Word 2020
After many months of exhaustive beta testing, we released [Chem4Word 2020](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/).  This release owes more to the underlying technology than the new features. 

The most substantial change is the new molecule sketcher.  The [Advanced CML-based Molecule Editor](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/2020/08/30/a-new-molecule-editor-in-chem4word-2020-introducing-acme/), or ACME for short, is a completely C#/WPF-based component.  We'd been using the GPL version of iChemLabs [ChemDoodle for Web](https://web.chemdoodle.com/#:~:text=ChemDoodle%20Web%20Components%20are%20pure,your%20websites%20and%20web%20applications.) up to now, but we'd been dodging ongoing concerns over license compatibility. Eventually we bit the bullet, and wrote our own sketcher.  This is ACME in action:

ACME can be dropped into any WPF or WinForms application, not just Chem4Word. Anyone writing a LOB cheminformatics application could use it.  It is however limited to Windows Desktop applications.  As Chem4Word up to now has been strictly Windows Desktop, then this hasn't been a limitation.  Our calculation is that there is a lot of mileage left in the VSTO/C# approach to crafting Office Add-Ins.  Time will tell whether this remains so, given Microsoft's ever-changing developer technology story.  

Other changes would appeal to the chemist more than the informatics developer.  We now support [functional groups](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/2020/08/31/functional-groups-now-included-in-chem4word-2020/) (shorthand for predefined layouts of atoms).  We have also incorporated a unique library of 2100+ substances from essential oils.  We've also improved performance, especially during rendering.  Structures now render quicker and with much higher quality.  The new Library component showcases these enhancements beautifully:

This has been a tough release to get out, especially given lockdown and the strictures of our new way of living and working.  However, it provides a very much more solid foundation for future enhancements to Chem4Word.
## Meetups

### Looking for speakers to go deep on AWS?

Would your user group \ meetup appreciate hearing about .NET on AWS from an AWS .NET developer advocate? The team of longtime .NET developers would be thrilled to join your virtual user group to chat about the latest for .NET in the cloud. 

Here’s a list of example topics:
- **Overview of .NET on AWS:** AWS has over a decade supporting .NET on the cloud. We’ll provide an overview of all the support you might not know existed, such as free tools for Visual Studio, PowerShell, Azure DevOps, etc.
- **Building serverless with .NET:** The future is now for serverless, and AWS is ensuring .NET is vibrant in that future. We’ll show you how anybody can get started and take advantage of the speed and ease of using serverless with .NET.
- **Infrastructure as .NET:** Why learn JSON or YAML to build on the cloud if you can just use .NET? Learn how to model and provision cloud resources in .NET with the open source AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
- **PowerShell on AWS:** AWS supports PowerShell and makes it easy to manage your AWS resources in a PowerShell scripting environment. We’ll show you all the things you can easily do on AWS with PowerShell, including native support for serverless. 
- **Something else?** What are you interested in hear about? Blazor? ML? Reach out and let us know.

You can contact the .NET developer advocacy team at **[aws-dotnetfdn-interest-open@amazon.com](mailto://aws-dotnetfdn-interest-open@amazon.com)**. Cheers!
